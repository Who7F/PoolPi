A friend showed me a YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEfHFsfGXjs&t=22s
With no knowledge of  how the maths worked, and with out looking at the solution.  I thought this would be a fun little program to write.
From the start I know the in put and the expected out put.
I also know If the blocks are of equal weight the momentum is transferred.  
And If what the block hits can't be moved the momentum is reflected. 

No graphical representation.  Just maths.

To be honest this problem wasn't as hard as I thought it was going to be, so I added a simple graph showing the combined speed of the momentum.
